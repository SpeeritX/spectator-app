## About
A project developed for the *Advanced Augmented Reality Project* course.  
It consists of two applications - one for mobile devices, and the second for Oculus VR headsets. The mobile application allows one to spectate the experience of another person wearing a VR headset. When both devices are in the same network, they connect automatically. Then, the users need to synchronize/calibrate the coordinate system in the mobile device by following the three-step synchronization process. It is required so that the movements of the phone are correctly reflected in the virtual environment of the headset.

This project is a prototype of a tool, that would allow other developers to create headset applications supporting a shared VR experience between users with different types of devices.

This repository contains the mobile app developed in Unity using the AR Foundation package.  
The [Oculus headset app](https://github.com/SpeeritX/vr-environment) was also developed in Unity using the Oculus integration package.
